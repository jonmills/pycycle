pycycle is a script which allows you to run a command repeatedly, 
while allowing you to easily adjust the delay between runs, or to pause
the execution at any time.

I use if you running unit-tests in a loop while I'm developing code.
I usually keep it running on my second screen so that it's obvious
if I've broken something.
